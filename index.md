# This is a GitHub Page in w0d0_precourse-challenge-hkmarcoot
w0d0_precourse-challenge-hkmarcoot created by GitHub Classroom

The first project in FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification - The tribute page. <br />
It is created using Codepen by HTML and CSS files. <br />
It is made for complete the School Of Code precourse challenge. <br />
I choose Elon Musk as the subject of the tribute page as he is the real world iron man and one of my favourite heros. <br />
Please refer to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page for what I learned in this challenge. <br />
The last one is a bit tricky, I found the solution by using margain: 0 auto; <br />
<br />
The files are add, commit, and push using Git skills on the command line in the VS Code terminal. <br />
